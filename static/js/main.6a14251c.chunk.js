It might be even better for customer service interactions. It does not, however, lead to traffic to your website that drives actual leads and customers.Google only includes quantifiable data in its search algorithms and because it doesn't have access to social media metrics, it disconnects social from search rankings.

It really can be that simple.\n          Instead, SEO is all about the time you invest and the expertise you bring to the table. If you are looking for external expertise, that does mean spending some money. But you don't need to budget anything for actual ads, because SEO is all about authenticity. It's your actual website or business that ranks, not promotional messages.\n          Even when you do invest some money, don't think about SEO as a cost.

Remember: You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\n          Viewed differently, your competition's head start might not actually be a bad thing. It gives you the opportunity to find the chinks in the Armor of your closest competitors. They're not doing all they can either, and once they reach a high spot on a relevant search results page, they tend to get lazy. Now is the time to strike.\n          Knowing what your competitors are doing is half the battle. Use some competitive SEO research to uncover their tactics and devise a strategy to beat them.

The first few months are dedicated to making updates to your site and waiting for the search engine spiders to crawl and index the changes. Depending on your website, the amount of work it requires, and the crawl frequency of the search engine spiders, it typically takes 3-9 months to begin seeing new rankings."},{que:"How long will it take to see increases in traffic?",ans:"Traffic is typically a direct result of an increase in rankings. Once your rankings begin to increase, you will also begin to see gradual increases in traffic to your website. Keep in mind that new rankings and traffic are not instantaneous, it takes a few months to complete the necessary updates and get them indexed before you will begin to see these increases."},{que:"Why should I continue SEO once I\u2019ve gotten good rankings?",ans:"Achieving the rankings is only half the battle. Since the search engines are constantly evolving and updating their algorithms, your rankings can fluctuate from one day to the next.
